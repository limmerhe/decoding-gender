## Comprehensive Analysis of Character-Agency through Computer-based Tools

### Abstract

Literature shapes cultural norms and heritage through language. Recent studies focus on gender in text analysis, with computerized methods like NLP offering efficient insights (xxx). Language reflects and reinforces gender stereotypes and power dynamics, but can also be a tool for resistance and subversion. Research shows how linguistic features contribute to maintaining gender-based inequalities. The combination of agency and gender analysis using computerized tools remains relatively unexplored. The thesis aims to investigate the correlation between fictional character agency, gender, and author gender, using the Gutenberg Corpus as research data. By utilizing the tools LIWC, Lingualyzer and BookNLP this research study intents to highlight the difficulties and challenges but also the advatages of using computationalized tools to analyze social concepts like agency.

### Data

This thesis used a small subset of the Gutenberg Project corpus, excluding non-fiction, poetry, drama, and other texts to focus on novels and short stories. This decision was based on meta-data and previous research by Nagaraj (XXX). Excluding other genres was important to avoid biased or inconclusive results. Random samples were taken to verify the subset's adherence to the criteria, ensuring the study's reliability and validity. The limited resources for the thesis necessitated a focused approach, eliminating time-consuming detailed examinations of all authors' texts and genres. This method was chosen to ensure a representative and unbiased sample for the study.
The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software, created by James W. Pennebaker, is widely used in psychology, sociology, and communication studies to analyze written texts quantitatively. While valuable, it has limitations such as predetermined categories and a focus on textual content rather than context or significance. Some features include a narrative arc analysis tool and the ability to process lagre amounts of texts with no prior programmin knowledge. Overall, LIWC can provide valuable insights into language usage and its effects on behavior, but should be used carefully to ensure accurate and reliable results.
To conduct my analysis on agency in narrative structures as well as on a lexical level, I divided each file into five sections using LIWC software for a more comprehensive comparison. The results were generated in .csv or .xlsx format, making it easy to combine them into a single document. The default English language dictionary in LIWC was used for further analysis. One work per author was chosen for analysis, with the data compiled into xlsx format and a graph for interpretation. The results provided insights into the narrative structures of the selected works.
