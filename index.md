## Comprehensive Analysis of Character-Agency through Computer-based Tools

### Abstract

<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left fa-border"></i>We tell stories to teach cultural norms, to entertain, and to help create shared perspec-tives (Boyd et al. 1)<i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-border"></i>

Literature shapes cultural norms and heritage through language. Recent studies focus on gender in text analysis, with computerized methods like NLP offering efficient insights (xxx). Language reflects and reinforces gender stereotypes and power dynamics, but can also be a tool for resistance and subversion. Research shows how linguistic features contribute to maintaining gender-based inequalities. The combination of agency and gender analysis using computerized tools remains relatively unexplored. The thesis aims to investigate the correlation between fictional character agency, gender, and author gender, using the Gutenberg Corpus as research data. By utilizing the tools LIWC, Lingualyzer and BookNLP this research study intents to highlight the difficulties and challenges but also the advatages of using computationalized tools to analyze social concepts like agency.

### Data and Results

This thesis used a small subset of the Gutenberg Project corpus, excluding non-fiction, poetry, drama, and other texts to focus on novels and short stories. This decision was based on meta-data and previous research by Nagaraj (XXX). Excluding other genres was important to avoid biased or inconclusive results. Random samples were taken to verify the subset's adherence to the criteria, ensuring the study's reliability and validity. The limited resources for the thesis necessitated a focused approach, eliminating time-consuming detailed examinations of all authors' texts and genres. This method was chosen to ensure a representative and unbiased sample for the study.
The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software, created by James W. Pennebaker, is widely used in psychology, sociology, and communication studies to analyze written texts quantitatively. While valuable, it has limitations such as predetermined categories and a focus on textual content rather than context or significance. Some features include a narrative arc analysis tool and the ability to process lagre amounts of texts with no prior programmin knowledge. Overall, LIWC can provide valuable insights into language usage and its effects on behavior, but should be used carefully to ensure accurate and reliable results.

To conduct my analysis on agency in narrative structures as well as on a lexical level, I divided each file into five sections using LIWC software for a more comprehensive comparison. The results were generated in .csv or .xlsx format, making it easy to combine them into a single document. The default English language dictionary in LIWC was used for further analysis. One work per author was chosen for analysis, with the data compiled into xlsx format and a graph for interpretation. The results provided insights into the narrative structures of the selected works.
The data indicates that female authors demonstrate a significantly higher level of agency in their writing compared to male authors, on average. The data indicates that, on average, female authors tend to use more positive emotion words and emotion words in general than male authors. Additionally, female authors tend to have a higher average positive tone than male authors but also have a higher negative tone on average. The findings reveal that male authors tend to use more male references, whereas fe-male authors tend to use more female references. Additionally, male authors use the first-person singular pronouns more frequently, while female authors prefer using the third-person singular. Both genders use the pronoun "they" less frequently, but the av-erage usage is slightly higher for males.

The results of the analysis revealed that there is a strong correlation between the de-gree of plot progression and the level of agency. This suggests that the more agency a character has, the more likely they are to drive the plot forward.
Conversely, the analysis also revealed a negative correlation between the level of stag-ing and agency. This means that the more a story is involved in setting the stage for events, the less agency the characters typically have.
Interestingly, the assumption that agency peaks when cognitive tension peaks was not supported by the evidence. While higher cognitive tension can lead to increased agen-cy in some cases, it is not a definitive predictor of agency levels. This could be at-tributed to the small sample size and is something that may be worth investigating in further research.
However, it is important to note that this methodology has its limitations. While it can help us identify patterns and trends in the overall narrative structure, it may not be suf-ficient to derive inferences at the individual character level. Additionally, the modest sample size may restrict its representativeness and we may not be able to generalize our findings to a larger population of stories. 
Overall, the findings of the LIWC analysis suggest that there is a significant distinction between the overall works of male and female authors regarding agency on a lexical level. As for the narrative arc analysis, a larger sample size or a more qualitative ap-proach might yield more impressive results.
